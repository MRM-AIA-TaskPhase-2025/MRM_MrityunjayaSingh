In task 3 we had to download the CSV file and push it :-\
First, I downloaded the CSV file and stored it inside the GitHub_task directory/
I had changes in the master branch in remote repo due to the previous tasks which I didnt have locally so I pulled the changes from remote repo using the git fetch origin command.\
Then I added the csv file using git add <file.CSV>.\
Then I commited the changes using git commit -m command.\
Then I pushed the file using the git push origin master.\
