In Task 1 we had to make a hello world program and save it in a folder named GitHub_task and had to push the folder inside our repository.
In order to do this the following steps were undertaken by me :-\
First, I made a directory by the help of mkdir command named GitHub_task.\
Then I created a program named HelloWorld.java and saved it inside the said Directory.\
I used the command cd and went inside the GitHub_task directory and used the git init command to initialise the repo.\
I used the command git add HelloWorld.java and then used the git commit -m to commit the Java File.\
I used , git config --global user.email "  ", to add my github account.\
I then proceeded to use the git remote add origin <repository_url>.\
Then I made a SSH key in GitHub and pushed the file using the git push -u origin master.\
I added my username and SSH as password to log in and the files were pushed.
